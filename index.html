            <h2>Hello,</h2>
            <p>
              I am finishing my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Nazarbayev University with overall cGPA 3.33.
              Being the top 20 student from 68 students in my department, I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics.
              In the 3rd year, after gaining some experience in Machine learning, I became a research
              assistant working on Kazakh Latin handwriting recognition, where I started to develop
              Computer Vision skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing research, I understood that practising in the Machine Learning field is more
              valuable than learning new theories, and for this reason, I started doing pet projects. 
              By conducting basketball team performance analysis and game result modelling, I
              recognized the importance of data collection and data analytics in boosting ML
              algorithms. While creating a Whatsapp chatbot with ML applications, I gain valuable
              skills in model deployment. All the work that I have done, including research activity and
              pet projects, gave me a complete understanding of how the whole Machine Learning
              oriented project takes place i.e. from data engineering to model production.
              </p>
            <p>
              Apart from academic achievements, I have been Nazarbayev University Basketball Team Player, as well as a member of Stand-up Comedy Club.
              Also, I have been a member of the Data Science Club, where I was responsible for the organization of the events and recruiting process.

            <h2>Analysis of Kernel Ridge Regression and Error Bound</h2>
            <p>
              The purpose of this paper was to conduct an analysis of Kernel Ridge Regression. 
              We generated the test and training data according to the Gaussian distribution. 
              After splitting the generated data we trained and evaluated it on our model. 
              Then, we tuned the parameters m (number of samples) and d (number of features) on which the error bound of ridge regression depends and compared the experimental results versus theoretical predictions. 
              The results showed that experimental difference between Test Error and Train error most of the time do not exceed the Theoretical Bound. 
              Finally, we evaluated our learning algorithm on the real data the same way as we did on the generated one. In this case, the results were the same, however with some errors.

              Stephen Curry's influence on Golden State Warriors(GSW) Performance and Predicting the Golden State Warriors(GSW) WIN/LOSS for 2012-2021 period games.
              I have conducted an analytical research on Stephen Curry's influence on Golden State Warriors(GSW) Performance.
              Also, I tried to predict whether GSW will win or loss on NBA games betweem 2012 and 2021. We examined 3 models such as Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors on predictig the GSW WIN/LOSS as our target value. 
              We have used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to see which set of parameters will give the most reliable results.
              Also Validation curves and Learning curves were plotted for each model, to show whether model overfits/underfits relating to hyperparameters and size of training set.
              Evaluation was done by ROC-AUC metric, as it is more reliable in terms of unbalanced data.
              If this research project will be continued, we'd like to research linearity/non-linearity of data, and also collinearity, as it might be reason of model relatively good/poor performance.
